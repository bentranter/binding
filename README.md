A how-to for calling C functions from every language.

Usage
---

Each language has their own folder, and in that folder is an example of how to call a C function from another language, as well as a README explaining how it works. The code is very basic, but provides a working example that (I hope!) serves a starting point for anyone wanting to call some C code from a different language.
