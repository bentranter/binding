Calling C from Ruby
---

Calling C from Ruby is pretty similar to the other languages in this repo - you write some C, write a function that maps function names, and generate a shared object so link with the Ruby runtime. However, Ruby has a utility to generate Makefiles based on your C code, which makes life about a million times easier, since there's no need to write an insane Makefile yourself.

The Ruby code for this is incredibly simple:

```ruby
require 'mkmf'
create_makefile 'your_C_lib_name'
```

This Ruby file must be named `extconf.rb`. To generate the Makefile, run `ruby extconf.rb`. From there, you can just run `make` and it'll generate the shared object. You call also run `make clean` to delete everything.

The C file is a bit different:

```c
#include <ruby.h>

static VALUE hello(int argc, VALUE *argv, VALUE self);
```

You (obviously) need to include the library `<ruby.h>`. Your functions that talk to Ruby need to start with `VALUE`, and have the arguments above in the function definition.

Unlike the other repos in here, this will work on both Unix and Windows machines, since the Makefile is generated for your platform.
